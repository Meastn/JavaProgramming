1. is a relation
2. extends keywods
3. super keyword & constructor
4. Types of Inheritance
5. Is a relation vs. Has a Relation
6. Method Overriding

TODAY (DAY 36)
IS A RELATION
EXTENDS KEYWORS

TOMORROW (DAY 37)
SUPER KEYWORD & CONSTRUCTOR
TYPES OF INHERITANCE

DAY 38
IS RELATION VS. HAS A RELATION
METHOD OVERRIDING

DAY 39
IMPLEMENT  BOTH INHERITANCE AND ENCAPSULATION

INHERİTANCE
1. used for creating an "is a" relationship among classes
2.when "is a " relationship exists between objects, it means that the specialized object
has all the characteristics of the general object
3. It allows one class to inherit the features (variables&methods) of another class

SUPER CLASS (PARENT CLASS)
A) ANIMAL (NAME, BODY, SIZE, WEİGHT, EAT, MOVE)

SUB CLASSES (CHILD CLASSES)
A1) DOG = ANIMAL + (LEGS, BARK)
A2) CAT  = ANIMAL + (LEGS, MEOW, SCRATCH)
A3) FISH = ANIMAL + (SWIM)


4. KEYWORD used for inheritance is EXTENDS

public class Dog extends Animal {

}

5. SUPER CLASS passes/ gives its characteristics to SUB CLASSES
6. SUB CLASSES takes the characteristics of their SUPER CLASS but also have their own
attributes, methods etc.
7. ALL the ACCESSIBLE (private objects and methods can not be seen) variables & methods (depending the ACCESS MODIFIER)
8. Constructors can not be inherited since it has to carry the same name with the class it is defined in
9. But CHILD can call PARENTS Constructor methods
10. Difference between importing and inheriting
    import : borrows    vs.  extends : owns
    Inherit -> pass it through, import -> let using

TASK

Create a super class called Animal
    Variables = name, breed, gender, size, age, color
    Methods = setInfo(), eat(), drink(), move(), sleep(), toString()

Create sub classes (child classes) of dog, cat, tiger

Dog extends Animal:
        bark ()
Cat extends Animal:
        scratch ()
Tiger extends Animal:
        roar ()
        hunt ()
Fish extends Animal:
        swim ()

Constructor Overloading:
We can create many constructors in the same class using the method overloading
that we used in Method Overloading,
But to do this we have to call one constructor from another,
this () we use this () keyword to call another constructor
PS.= this. is used to call instance variable & instance methods
Constructor Overloading creates a chain of constructors that call the one before and be called by the next

CONSTRUCTOR CALL:
1. Constructor can not be called by its name (this () need to be used)
2. Only a constructor can call another constructor
3. Constructor call MUST be at the first stage. Otherwise it gives a COMPILE ERROR
4. One Constructor can not call more than one constructor at a time

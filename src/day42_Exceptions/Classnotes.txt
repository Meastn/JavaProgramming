EXCEPTION HANDLING

When there is an exception the code stops
working. Therefore we can not see what
is happening to the rest of the code.
We need it to run until the end.
So we handle exceptions to keep the code
running even in case of an exception.
There are two types of exceptions:
    1. checked exception
    2. unchecked exception

Exception is a java object of the THROWABLE class.
NOTE: We also can throw and exception MANUALLY if we want.

What is the difference between an error and
exception?
Runtime errors are due to bad coding
Compile time errors: your codes does not even Compile

WE DO NOT USUALLY HANDLE BAD CODING (try & catch)
